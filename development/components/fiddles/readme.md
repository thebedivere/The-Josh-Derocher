#zip code form
This simple form just returns an address for an entered Zip Code. jQuery watches for changes on the form, then a GET request is sent to Google's Maps API with the entered Zip Code. The returned address is then shown to the user.

The code for this isn't on GitHub, but you can look at it in the embedded JSFiddle.

#Media search
Search for movies, TV shows, and video games by title. Created using the [OMDb API](http://omdbapi.com/). Clicking on the title or image will show you more details about the movie.

The code for this can be found in fiddles.html and fiddles.js.
